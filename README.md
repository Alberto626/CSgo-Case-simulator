# Counter Strike Global Offensive Case Simulator

This is a old React Native project I contributed in a school project. The goal was to simulator a slot machine based attraction based off the popular video game Counter Strike Global Offensive.
We used a public api to store data locally. We then used a simple algorithm to determine what random gun skin should the player get. Afterwards, we used a random number generator to determine the quality of that skin.

The first algorithm used a random number and used a random number interval to determine a rarity. For example, if the number is between 99.1 - 100 then the player gets the Covert skin(rarest skin type).

This was my contribution to the project. The final end product is https://github.com/LandaJose/csgoSimulator.

My version has updated sdks to work since the project is old and used deprecated sdks.

Now we change the directory to where you saved this project.
To install packages, do `npm install` or `yarn install`. Now this project is ready to start.
